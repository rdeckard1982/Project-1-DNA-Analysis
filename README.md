# Project-1-DNA-Analysis
A program that analyzes and outputs data on any DNA. Created for my Starting Computing class.
Basic functions include:
1. Check whether your DNA strands are composed of valid bases
2. Develop functions to compare DNA strands and assess their similarity
3. Develop a function that compares two DNA sequences and identifies all types of mutations between
them
4. Transcribe DNA to RNA and compute the reverse complement of a DNA strand
5. Find open reading frames within a DNA strand
